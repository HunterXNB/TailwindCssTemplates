transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
the tree intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
weeks was the best and most grueling-timf my life. Since completing the course, I've
successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

            <p class="describtion  ">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've
never written a line of code. I needed
some structure from professionals
who can help me learn programming
step by step. I was encouraged to
enroll by a former student of theirs
who can only say wonderful things
about the program. The entire
curriculum and staff did not
disappoint. They were very hands-on
and I never had to wait long for
assistance. The agile team project, in
particular, was outstanding. It took
my learning to the next level in a way
that no tutorial could ever have. In
fact, I've often referred to it during
interviews as an example of my
developent experience. It certainly
helped me land a job as a full-stack
developer after receiving multiple
offers, 100% recommend!"</p>
